## Learning Objectives

After playing Space Gravity, students will understand:

1. ✅ Gravity is a constant force that pulls objects downward
2. ✅ Different planets have different gravitational strength
3. ✅ Moving objects don't stop instantly (inertia)
4. ✅ Energy (fuel) is a limited resource that must be managed
5. ✅ Planning and timing are important in physics problems

## Physics Concepts

### 1. Gravity – The Invisible Force

**What the game teaches:**
The spacecraft constantly accelerates downward, even when the player does nothing.

**Real physics:**
- Gravity is a force that pulls all objects with mass toward each other
- On planets, gravity pulls everything toward the center
- The acceleration is constant (doesn't speed up or slow down)
- Near Earth's surface: 9.8 m/s² (every second, you fall 9.8 m/s faster)

**In-game experience:**
- Release all controls → ship falls faster and faster
- Can't "hover" without using thrust
- Different planets = different fall speeds

**Key insight:** Gravity never "turns off" – you must constantly fight against it!

### 2. Inertia – Objects in Motion Stay in Motion

**What the game teaches:**
The spacecraft can't stop instantly. If moving downward, it takes time and fuel to slow down.

**Real physics:**
- Newton's First Law: An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by a force
- To stop, you need to apply an opposite force
- The faster you're going, the more force (and time) needed to stop

**In-game experience:**
- Start braking BEFORE you reach the landing pad
- Waiting too long = crashing
- Faster descent = need more thrust to stop

**Key insight:** Start braking early! You can't stop instantly.

### 3. Energy Conservation – Fuel is Limited

**What the game teaches:**
Thrust uses fuel. When fuel runs out, you can't thrust anymore.

**Real physics:**
- Energy cannot be created from nothing
- Rockets carry limited fuel
- Every action (thrust) uses energy
- Must budget energy for the entire mission

**In-game experience:**
- Fuel gauge decreases when thrusting
- No fuel = no control = crash
- Must balance speed vs. fuel consumption

**Key insight:** Use energy wisely – you can't make more!

### 4. Velocity and Acceleration

**What the game teaches:**
Speed changes gradually. You can see velocity in the HUD.

**Real physics:**
- Velocity = how fast something is moving (and in what direction)
- Acceleration = how velocity changes over time
- Gravity causes constant acceleration downward
- Thrust causes acceleration upward (when applied)

**In-game experience:**
- Speed number shows current velocity
- Green = safe, Yellow = caution, Red = danger
- Speed changes smoothly, not instantly

## Planet Science

### 🌙 Moon

**Real Facts:**
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Surface Gravity | 1.62 m/s² |
| Compared to Earth | 16.6% (about 1/6) |
| Atmosphere | None |
| Surface | Rocky, covered in craters |

**Why landing is easier:**
- Low gravity = slower falling
- More time to react
- Less fuel needed to slow down
- No wind (no atmosphere)

**Fun fact:** Astronauts on the Moon could jump 6 times higher than on Earth!

### 🔴 Mars

**Real Facts:**
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Surface Gravity | 3.72 m/s² |
| Compared to Earth | 38% (about 1/3) |
| Atmosphere | Thin (CO₂) |
| Surface | Rocky, red iron oxide dust |

**Why landing is medium difficulty:**
- Higher gravity than Moon
- Has thin atmosphere = wind exists
- Need more fuel management
- Famous missions: Perseverance, Curiosity rovers

**Fun fact:** Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system (Olympus Mons)!

### 🌍 Earth

**Real Facts:**
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Surface Gravity | 9.81 m/s² |
| Compared to Earth | 100% (baseline) |
| Atmosphere | Thick (nitrogen, oxygen) |
| Surface | 71% water, varied terrain |

**Why landing is hardest:**
- Strongest gravity = fastest falling
- Strong wind effects
- Requires precise control
- Most fuel consumption

**Fun fact:** Earth is the only planet not named after a god!

## For Teachers

### Age Appropriateness

- **Recommended ages:** 5-10 years
- **Reading level:** Simple English
- **Math required:** None (concepts are visual)

### Curriculum Connections

| Subject | Topics |
|---------|--------|
| Physics | Gravity, motion, forces |
| Earth Science | Planets, solar system |
| Math | Estimation, resource management |
| Technology | Cause and effect, systems thinking |

### Classroom Setup

1. **Individual play:** Each student on their own device
2. **Partner play:** One navigates, one advises
3. **Group demonstration:** Project on screen, class discusses

### Lesson Plan Ideas

#### Lesson 1: Introduction to Gravity (30 min)
1. Ask: "What happens when you drop something?"
2. Play Moon Level 1 together
3. Discuss: Why does the ship fall?
4. Compare: What would happen with MORE gravity?

#### Lesson 2: Comparing Planets (45 min)
1. Play one level on each planet
2. Record observations:
   - Which was easiest/hardest?
   - How did the ship behave differently?
3. Research: Look up real gravity values
4. Discuss: Why is Earth gravity strongest?

#### Lesson 3: Energy and Planning (30 min)
1. Challenge: Complete a level with minimum fuel use
2. Discuss: What strategies save fuel?
3. Connect: How do real spacecraft manage fuel?

## Discussion Questions

### For Younger Students (7-8)

1. Why does the spaceship always fall down?
2. What happens if you run out of fuel?
3. Which planet was easiest? Why?
4. What would happen if there was no gravity?

### For Older Students (9-10)

1. How does gravity on Mars compare to Earth?
2. Why can't the ship stop instantly?
3. What strategies help you save fuel?
4. How might real astronauts use these concepts?

### For Advanced Discussion

1. How do spacecraft actually land on Mars?
2. What is terminal velocity and why doesn't it appear in this game?
3. How do rockets work in the vacuum of space?
4. What other forces affect real spacecraft (drag, radiation pressure)?
